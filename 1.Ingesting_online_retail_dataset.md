#### Step 2: Data ingestion 
Loaded the CSV file online_retail dataset including changing the invoice column data type that was before 'timestamp' which is now 'VARCHAR' and removed the index column because of loading errors. 

```
CREATE TABLE online_retail (
	InvoiceNo VARCHAR,
	StockCode VARCHAR,
	Description VARCHAR,
	Quantity INT,
	InvoiceDate VARCHAR,
	UnitPrice NUMERIC,
	CustomerID VARCHAR,
	Country VARCHAR
);
```

#### This was the copy command I ran in the psql tool editor.
